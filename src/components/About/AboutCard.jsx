            Hello, I‚Äôm <b className="purple">Apoorv Verma</b> ‚Äî a Full Stack
            Developer and Team Lead who writes code with precision and leads
            with purpose. Born in Patna and seasoned across cities, my career is
            a reflection of relentless curiosity and growth.
            <br />
            <br />
            After graduating in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering in
            2020, I began my journey at First Advantage. But it was in 2022, at{" "}
            <b className="purple">FunctionUp</b>, where my developer journey
            truly took shape. I evolved from a frontend trainee to a Teaching
            Assistant, mentoring others and diving deep into ReactJS.
            <br />
            <br />
            My path led me to impactful collaborations with companies like{" "}
            <b className="purple">Snabbtech</b>, before taking on a leadership
            role at <b className="purple">Protech Business Consulting</b>. Here,
            I architect full-stack systems ‚Äî building commercial-grade
            platforms, leading team sprints, managing role-based workflows, OTP
            auth flows, and even handling massive datasets of over 40 million
            records.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of work, I express through{" "}
            <b className="purple">blogging</b>, sharing thoughts on technology,
            mental health, and personal growth. You‚Äôll often find me cruising on
            my Royal Enfield, enjoying the hum of the engine and the stillness
            of open roads. üèçÔ∏è
            <br />
            <br />
            Every day, I aim to balance tech, mentorship, and mindfulness ‚Äî
            coding not just for systems, but for experiences that leave a mark.
            <br />
            <br />
            Let‚Äôs connect and build something meaningful ‚Äî in code, in life, or
            on the next great road trip.
